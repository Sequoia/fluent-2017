## Why Containers
[source](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) (good explanation of kubernetes' benefits and those of containerization generally)

* Agile application creation and deployment: Increased ease and efficiency of container image creation compared to VM image use.
* Continuous development, integration, and deployment: Provides for reliable and frequent container image build and deployment with quick and easy rollbacks (due to image immutability).
* Dev and Ops separation of concerns: Create application container images at build/release time rather than deployment time, thereby decoupling applications from infrastructure.
* Environmental consistency across development, testing, and production: Runs the same on a laptop as it does in the cloud.
* Cloud and OS distribution portability: Runs on Ubuntu, RHEL, CoreOS, on-prem, Google Container Engine, and anywhere else.
* Application-centric management: Raises the level of abstraction from running an OS on virtual hardware to run an application on an OS using logical resources.
* Loosely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated micro-services: Applications are broken into smaller, independent pieces and can be deployed and managed dynamically â€“ not a fat monolithic stack running on one big single-purpose machine.
* Resource isolation: Predictable application performance.
* Resource utilization: High efficiency and density.
